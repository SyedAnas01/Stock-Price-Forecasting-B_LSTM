# Stock-Price-Forecasting-B_LSTM


Forecasting stock price and intraday direction is an important problem in the field of Quantitative Finance. This project explores the efficacy of using Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Model (to be precise LSTM+BNN) for stock price forecasting. We plan to test the models’ performance against other ML models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, Vanilla LSTM etc.). We are collecting data of a few publicly listed Indian stocks from Yahoo Finance python library. The model will be deployed through a webapp, that will display the model’s predictions for a few selected stocks along with some statistical metrics to account for the level of confidence and uncertainty with respect to the predictions.
